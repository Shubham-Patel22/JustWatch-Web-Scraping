# JustWatch-Web-Scraping
In this project, I have done web scraping on JustWatch website. JustWatch is a popular website that lists shows and movies along with streaming sites where you can watch them. In the Web Scraping, I have only taken movies and shows from the year 2000 onwards. I was able to obtain data of 110 movies and 110 shows. After Web Scraping, I have performed data cleaning. Then I have done Exploratory Data Analysis after data filtering to find insights about shows and movies on JustWatch website. Finally, I have exported the data to CSV files.
